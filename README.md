# ATMega328P_USART
Basic USART library for the AVR ATMega328P

The files attached are functions to control the USART in an ATMega328P Atmel microcontroller.

"include" the file in your program by adding it to "include" folder in your Atmel Studio program files directory. Example [C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Studio\7.0\toolchain\avr8\avr8-gnu-toolchain\avr\include\JTA\USART_Init.h]
(I created a subfolder called "JTA" because I did not have permissions or something to store the file where I wanted too)

Included in this repo is an example program using the features of the USART.
